# Temporal Core Concepts

This document captures key concepts and learnings about Temporal's architecture and programming model.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Workflows
- Definition: Long-running, reliable business logic
- Key characteristics:
  - [ ] Durability
  - [ ] Determinism
  - [ ] History and state management
  - [ ] Error handling

### 2. Activities
- Definition: Individual tasks that workflows orchestrate
- Key characteristics:
  - [ ] Idempotency considerations
  - [ ] Retry policies
  - [ ] Heartbeat mechanics
  - [ ] Activity timeouts

### 3. Workers
- Definition: Service processes that execute workflow and activity code
- Key points:
  - [ ] Task queues
  - [ ] Worker options
  - [ ] Resource management
  - [ ] Sticky execution

### 4. Task Queues
- Purpose and usage
- Load balancing
- Worker assignment
