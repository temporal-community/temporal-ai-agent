# Learning Journey: Temporal AI Agent Experiments

This directory contains my personal notes, experiments, and learnings while exploring the Temporal AI Agent system. The goal is to understand how to effectively use agentic systems within Temporal's durable workflow model.

## Directory Structure

- [`experiments/`](./experiments/): Detailed documentation of specific experiments and tests
  - Each experiment is numbered for easy reference
  - Contains setup, observations, and results

- [`learnings/`](./learnings/): Key concepts and patterns discovered
  - Temporal concepts
  - Agent patterns
  - Challenges and solutions

- [`resources/`](./resources/): Useful references and links
  - External documentation
  - Relevant articles
  - Community discussions

## Quick Start

The experiments are numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.) and can be found in the `experiments/` directory. Each experiment includes:
- Objective
- Setup instructions
- Code changes/additions
- Results and observations
- Learnings and takeaways

## Key Topics

1. Temporal Workflows with AI Agents
2. Agent-based Decision Making
3. Durable Execution Patterns
4. Error Handling and Recovery
5. Testing and Debugging Strategies

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Basic workflow setup and execution
- [ ] Agent integration and configuration
- [ ] Complex decision-making scenarios
- [ ] Error handling and recovery patterns
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Production-ready considerations

## Notes

- This is a learning repository forked from the original temporal-ai-agent demo
- These notes are personal and reflect my learning journey
- Feel free to adapt and modify the structure as needed
